## 2.0.0

- Rename "Omenad Meend" fonts to "Ome Bhatkhande"

## 1.0.0

- Initial public release of Ome Swarlipi and Omenad Meend fonts
- Omenad Meend fonts are versioned 1.2.0 to account for differences from the
  original 2007 release, but that was internal and never made public. Thus,
  effectively, this is 1.0.0 for all of them. Ome Swarlipi has not had any
  changes since its 2007 version.
